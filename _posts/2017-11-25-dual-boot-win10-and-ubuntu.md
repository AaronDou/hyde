title: Dual boot Win10 and Ubuntu
---

I have been studying deep learning recently. After finishing Andrew Ng's DL specialization on Coursera, I thought it was time for me to look at some actual codes and make my hands dirty. Starting from Caffe2 would be a good option for me. There was a testing version of Caffe2 for Windows, but I was not gonna risk my time on the less unstable version. Realizing that I had not installed any Ubuntu on my X1 Carbon laptop yet, the first thing to get started was to create dual boot for the current Win10 and a Ubuntu. I chose Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit version.

To install dual boot with a USB, 
* The first thing is to create a bootable Ubuntu copy from the downloaded ISO. The USB should be formatted to FAT32 to allow UEFI boot option.
* Then rise USB's boot priority to the highest in BIOS. Disable secure boot. Allow only UEFI boot option. Reboot and follow instructions to install Ubuntu.
