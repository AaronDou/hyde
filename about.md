Hola! I'm currently a Research Scientist at [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Engineering at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu/) in 2017. During my graduate study, I've interned at Facebook Infra team. I obtained my bachelor degree from [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2013. 

I am a regular donator to the [Wikimedia Foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home).
